# MellowYellows

## Introduction
Do you often admire the beautiful scenes of numerous stars and the moon rising and setting in the night sky of our planet? I enjoy taking pictures of beautiful stars and various shapes of the moon, so I frequently capture them with my camera. Before taking a picture, I often check the current phase of the moon and the weather. This is because the shape of the moon changes every day, and the sky may not be visible when there are clouds or rain. Moreover, the moon is too bright, so to see the stars better, there should be no moon. MellowYellows is an iOS app that allows you to check the weather conditions in advance. You can check the phase of the moon for today while listening to mellow music. Not only for today, but you can also choose the date you want to check, and a short message about night sky photography based on the phase of the moon will be displayed. Beautiful stars move in the sky, and their brightness is also expressed differently depending on the phase of the moon. You can also check the weather (random) for the day, and if it's cloudy or rainy, clouds will appear on the screen. With MellowYellows, you can cultivate your interest in the night sky and enjoy the gift that can only be found on our planet!
